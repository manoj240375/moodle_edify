<div class="theme_description"><h2>About</h2><p>Broad Study is a fluid-width, three-column theme for Moodle 2.0 that was created by 99Template.com.<h2>Tweaks</h2><p>This theme is built upon both Base and Canvas, two parent themes included in the Moodle core. If you want to modify this theme, we recommend that you first duplicate it then rename it before making your changes. This will prevent your customized theme from being overwritten by future Moodle upgrades, and you\'ll still have the original files if you make a mess.</div></div>';
