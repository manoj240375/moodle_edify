Magazine, a moodle 2.x theme by johnSt (http://stabinger.us). 

Magazine is a three column flexible width theme. It can use the new moodle menu dropdowns and the moodle dock. Most images used are semi-transparent so that you can easily change the look of the theme by changing the background color hex code. It has three css files. The colors.css file contains color codes to change the overall look of the theme. It also has the code to change the logo. Note, you can change the colors, logo and background image via the theme's admin settings page.

Some icons used in this theme are from the Splashy Icon set and are freely available at http://splashyfish.com/icons/. 

Please contact me at john@stabinger.us if you have any questions, concerns or feedback. 

I hope you enjoy this theme and have fun modifying it. If you make any interesting mods of this theme, please let me know!
