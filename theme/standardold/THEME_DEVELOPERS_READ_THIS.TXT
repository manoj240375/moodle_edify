This legacy standard theme is here only for developers that need to work
on general issues before we create new 'base' theme and new 'standard' theme.

The layouts in this theme are table based and in general are completely useless.

The CSS files contain a lot of weird markup that was accumulated over the years,
please make sure you copy only good CSS with proper selectors from here.

Some CSS from this theme will be gradully copied into the 'base' theme,
some CSS will be copied into new 'standard' theme. Some CSS will be deleted.


This theme will be removed from CVS when we have new 'standard' theme.
